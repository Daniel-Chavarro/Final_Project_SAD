# Drawing with LLMs: System Analysis, Design, and Simulation

This project, developed for the Kaggle competition "Drawing with LLMs," focuses on designing a robust and modular system to translate natural language prompts into valid SVG images using Large Language Models (LLMs). The core challenge is to generate visually representative and syntactically correct SVG code while adhering to strict constraints, such as file size and allowed elements.

Through a systematic, three-phase approach grounded in systems engineering principles, the project involved:
1.  **Comprehensive Problem Analysis:** Decomposing the problem space and defining system requirements.
2.  **Advanced System Design:** Architecting a scalable, modular solution to handle the complexities of LLM-based generation.
3.  **Simulation and Validation:** Conducting extensive simulations to validate the design and optimize for performance and compliance.

This repository contains the full implementation, documentation, and outputs of the project.

## Directory Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `code/`: Contains all the source code and generated outputs.
  - `System_simulation.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook for running the system simulation.
  - `system-kaggle.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook tailored for the Kaggle competition submission.
  - `requirements.txt`: A list of Python dependencies required to run the notebooks.
  - `graphics/`: Contains plots and graphs generated by the simulations.
  - `logs/`: Stores JSON reports and logs from simulation runs.
  - `svgs/`: Contains generated SVG images, which are the primary output of the system.
- `docs/`: Contains all project documentation.
  - `Paper.pdf`: The project research paper.
  - `Poster.pdf`: The project poster.
  - `Presentation.pdf`: The project presentation slides.
  - `Technical_Report.pdf`: A detailed report covering the system analysis, design, and simulation results.
- `LICENSE`: The project's license file.
- `README.md`: This file.

## How to Run the Code

The primary simulation and development were performed using Jupyter Notebooks. The `system-kaggle.ipynb` is specifically prepared for submission to the Kaggle platform.

### Running in Google Colab (Recommended)

The notebooks are designed to be run in Google Colab, which provides a convenient, pre-configured environment.

1.  **Open in Colab:** Upload the `System_simulation.ipynb` or `system-kaggle.ipynb` notebook from the `code/` directory to Google Colab.
2.  **Install Dependencies:** The first code cell in the notebook will typically contain the necessary `pip install` commands for dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. Run this cell to set up the environment.
3.  **API Keys:** If using an LLM that requires an API key (like Gemini), you will need to add your key to the Colab "Secrets" manager for secure access. The notebook will guide you on this.
4.  **Execute Cells:** Run the notebook cells sequentially to perform the simulation.

### Running Locally

To run the notebooks on a local machine:

#### 1. Set Up the Environment

It is highly recommended to use a Python virtual environment.

```bash
# Navigate to the project root directory
# Create a virtual environment (e.g., named 'venv')
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages from the `code` directory.

```bash
pip install -r code/requirements.txt
```

#### 3. Launch Jupyter and Run the Notebook

1.  Start Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    # For Jupyter Lab
    jupyter lab

    # Or for the classic Jupyter Notebook
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2.  In the Jupyter interface, navigate to the `code/` directory.
3.  Open `System_simulation.ipynb` or `system-kaggle.ipynb` and execute the cells.

## Project Outputs

The simulation notebooks are designed to be run in Google Colab. When executed, they will generate the following outputs within the Colab environment:

- **Plots:** Visualizations and graphs.
- **Logs:** JSON reports from the simulation.
- **SVGs:** Vector graphics.

These files will be available for download directly from the Colab interface. The `graphics/`, `logs/`, and `svgs/` directories in this repository contain examples of these outputs from previous runs.
