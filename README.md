# Final Project SAD

[**Please add a brief description of your project here.** This project appears to be a system simulation, based on the file names.]

This document provides a summary of the project, its file structure, and instructions on how to execute the code.

## Directory Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `code/`: Contains all the source code and generated outputs.
  - `System_simulation.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook for running the system simulation.
  - `system-kaggle.ipynb`: Another Jupyter Notebook, possibly related to a Kaggle dataset or competition.
  - `requirements.txt`: A list of Python dependencies required to run the notebooks.
  - `graphics/`: Contains plots and graphs generated by the simulations.
  - `logs/`: Stores JSON reports and logs from simulation runs.
  - `svgs/`: Contains generated SVG images.
- `docs/`: Contains all project documentation.
  - `Paper.pdf`: The project research paper.
  - `Poster.pdf`: The project poster.
  - `Presentation.pdf`: The project presentation slides.
  - `Technical_Report.pdf`: The detailed technical report.
- `LICENSE`: The project's license file.
- `README.md`: This file.

## How to Run the Code

To run the simulations, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab installed.

### 1. Set Up the Environment

It is highly recommended to use a Python virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
# Navigate to the project root directory
# Create a virtual environment (e.g., named 'venv')
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using the `requirements.txt` file located in the `code` directory.

```bash
pip install -r code/requirements.txt
```

### 3. Launch Jupyter and Run the Notebook

1.  Once the dependencies are installed, start Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook from your terminal:
    ```bash
    # For Jupyter Lab
    jupyter lab

    # Or for the classic Jupyter Notebook
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2.  Your web browser will open the Jupyter interface.
3.  Navigate into the `code/` directory.
4.  Open either `System_simulation.ipynb` or `system-kaggle.ipynb`.
5.  Follow the instructions within the notebook and run the cells to execute the simulation.

## Project Outputs

The simulation notebooks are designed to be run in Google Colab. When executed, they will generate the following outputs within the Colab environment:

- **Plots:** Visualizations and graphs.
- **Logs:** JSON reports from the simulation.
- **SVGs:** Vector graphics.

These files will be available for download directly from the Colab interface. The `graphics/`, `logs/`, and `svgs/` directories in this repository contain examples of these outputs from previous runs.
